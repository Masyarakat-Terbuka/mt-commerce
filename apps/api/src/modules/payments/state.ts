/**
 * Payment status state machine — pure helpers, no I/O.
 *
 * Mirrors the orders module's `state.ts` shape so the two surfaces stay
 * symmetric (a future reviewer reading either file knows what to expect
 * from the other).
 *
 * Diagram:
 *
 *   pending ───► authorized ───► captured ───► refunded
 *      │             │              │
 *      │             ├──► failed    ├──► failed
 *      │             └──► cancelled └──► cancelled
 *      ├──► captured (capture-on-initiate providers)
 *      ├──► failed
 *      └──► cancelled
 *
 * Allowed transitions (also captured in TRANSITIONS below):
 *   - pending      → authorized | captured | failed | cancelled
 *   - authorized   → captured | failed | cancelled
 *   - captured     → refunded | failed | cancelled
 *   - failed       → (terminal)
 *   - refunded     → (terminal)
 *   - cancelled    → (terminal)
 *
 * `failed` is terminal — a failed charge is the customer's signal to
 * try a different method. The service refuses re-initiating against the
 * same `payments` row; the storefront writes a fresh row instead. This
 * keeps the audit trail honest about what happened on each attempt.
